        "# Predicting Movie Revenue from Pre‑Release Features (The Movies Dataset / Kaggle)\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "This Jupyter notebook is part of the final project for the **Machine Learning** course at **GISMA University of Applied Sciences**.  \n",
        "The goal is to predict a movie’s **box‑office revenue** using only **pre‑release information** (features available before the movie is released), such as budget, runtime, genres, release year, and historical “track record” features for cast and key crew roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle: **“The Movies Dataset” (Rounak Banik)**. The metadata includes movie attributes (e.g., budget, runtime, genres, release date) plus cast/crew lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Predicting revenue is challenging because revenues are **highly skewed** and influenced by many interacting factors. To handle skewness, I model **log1p(revenue)** and later convert predictions back to the revenue scale.  \n",
        "Finally, I interpret the model output as a **revenue interval** (a practical range) rather than a single point estimate, for example, this model does not say that the revenue will be exactly 10.5 million dollars. Instead, it might say that the expected revenue is around 10 million dollars with an uncertainty of about ±3 million, which means the value is likely to be between roughly 7 and 13 million dollars.\n",

The original genres column is a JSON-like string, so I first parse it and extract the list of genre names for each movie. Since a movie can have more than one genre, I apply multi-hot encoding with MultiLabelBinarizer to create one binary column per genre (for example genre_action, genre_comedy, genre_drama), where each column is 1 if the movie belongs to that genre and 0 otherwise. This converts the multi-genre data into a clean numeric format that the model can use, and after that the original genres and genre_list columns are no longer needed and are removed.\n",

        "Model Selection Rationale\n",
        "\n",
        "Here multiple regression models are evaluated to understand how different modeling assumptions affect revenue prediction. Each model is chosen for a specific reason, ranging from simple baselines to more expressive non-linear methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ridge Regression is used as a linear baseline model. It extends standard linear regression by adding regularization, which helps control overfitting when the number of features is large. Ridge regression also provides a strong reference point to compare more complex models against a simple, interpretable approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random Forest Regressor is included to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions that linear models cannot represent. By combining many decision trees, random forests are robust to noise and can model complex patterns in tabular data without requiring strong assumptions about feature distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regressor is selected as a more advanced ensemble method that incrementally improves predictions by correcting previous errors. This model is well-suited for large tabular datasets, handles non-linearities efficiently, and often achieves strong performance with relatively little feature scaling or manual tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these models provide a balanced comparison between interpretability, flexibility, and predictive performance, allowing the final model choice to be based on empirical results rather than assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "And it's good to mention that the Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) do not require feature scaling.\n",
        "For linear models (here Ridge), scaling is applied inside the sklearn Pipeline during model selection to avoid data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "And for validation I went with K-Fold cross-validation as a balanced and practical approach. A single hold-out split can lead to unstable results depending on how the data is divided, while K-Fold reduces this risk by averaging performance across multiple folds. Leave-one-out validation is also a computationally expensive method for a dataset of this size and does not provide clear advantages here. Although the data has a time component, the temporal dependency is already handled by the train–test split, and K-Fold cross-validation within the training set offers a good trade-off between reliability and efficiency for model selection."

        "An MAE of 1.3914 in log space means that, on average, the absolute difference between the predicted and true log(1 + revenue) is about 1.39. When we map this back to the original revenue scale, this corresponds to a multiplicative error of about exp(1.3914) ≈ 4.02. In practical terms, a typical prediction is within a factor of about 4 of the true revenue. For example, if the model predicts 10 million dollars for a movie, the true revenue is often somewhere in a range roughly between 10 / 4 ≈ 2.5 million and 10 × 4 ≈ 40 million.\n",
        "\n",
        "The RMSE of 1.9353 in log space is larger than the MAE, which is expected, because RMSE gives more weight to larger errors. It mainly confirms that there are some movies where the model makes bigger mistakes, but for the typical case the multiplicative error factor ≈ 4.02 (derived from MAE) is the main quantity I use to interpret and present the model’s performance.\n",

There is no “correct” or “incorrect” class, only predictions that are closer or farther from the true value.\n",
        "\n",
        "I use **MAE** as the main evaluation metric, because it is more robust to extreme values in this skewed, log-transformed target and directly measures the typical absolute prediction error. I still compute **RMSE** as a secondary metric to report a squared-error perspective, but I do not use it for model selection or for building the revenue range, since RMSE is highly sensitive to a few very large residuals. I also do not rely on **R²** as the primary metric, because it focuses on the proportion of variance explained and is scale-free."

        "\n",
        "- **Data quality and coverage.** The raw dataset has a major limitation: around 84% of movies have a recorded revenue of zero, which in many cases likely means that the true revenue is missing or not reported. For this reason, the modeling dataset is restricted to movies with strictly positive revenue. This improves target quality but reduces the effective sample size and may bias the model towards better-documented and more commercially visible titles. In addition, some core features such as `budget` and `runtime` also contain missing or noisy values and require filtering, which further reduces the dataset.(I shown this in 3.6.0 section)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Limited pre-release information.** The model is intentionally restricted to features that are available before release (budget, genre, release year, cast and crew history). However, several strong drivers of revenue are not included, such as marketing spend, distribution strategy, release window, competition from other releases, and brand/franchise effects. As a result, the model can only capture part of the true signal, and its predictions should be seen as coarse forecasts rather than precise financial estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Approximate modeling of star power and track record.** The cast and crew features rely on approximations: actors are selected based on billing order (top 5 cast members), and historical performance for directors, writers, and producers is summarized via median past revenue and past movie counts. These features reduce sparsity and capture some notion of “track record”, but they cannot fully represent how audience perception, role importance, or uncredited work influence revenue in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model accuracy and uncertainty.** Even after log transformation, the final model’s typical multiplicative error is around a factor of 4 on the original revenue scale. This means that predictions are often within a broad revenue range rather than close to the exact value. For this reason, model outputs are interpreted as revenue intervals based on the typical error, instead of precise point estimates."
