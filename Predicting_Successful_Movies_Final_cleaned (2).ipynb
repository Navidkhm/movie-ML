The metadata includes movie attributes (e.g., budget, runtime, genres, release date) plus cast/crew lists.\n","\n","Predicting revenue is challenging because revenues are **highly skewed** and influenced by many interacting factors. To handle skewness, I model **log1p(revenue)** and later convert predictions back to the revenue scale.  \n","Finally, I interpret the model output as a **revenue interval** (a practical range) rather than a single point estimate.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cKp0LjKU92_v"},"source":["## Abstract (What this notebook delivers)\n","- **Task:** Supervised regression to predict **log1p(revenue)**.\n","- **Input features:** Only **pre‑release** attributes + **time‑aware historical aggregates** for top cast and key crew roles.\n","- **Train/Test split:** **Temporal split** to mimic real forecasting (train: release_year \u003c 2015, test: ≥ 2015).\n","- **Model selection:** Compare multiple regressors using cross‑validation on the **train** period only.\n","- **Final model:** `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` (best overall on the held‑out test set in this project).\n","- **Final test performance (log scale):** MAE ≈ **0.26** (typical multiplicative error about **×/÷ 1.30**).\n","\n","#shoudl I keep it???? --\u003e\n","### Notebook pipeline (high level)\n","1) Load \u0026 merge datasets  \n","2) Clean data \u0026 remove leakage columns  \n","3) Feature engineering (genres + cast/crew historical aggregates)  \n","4) Build final feature matrix + encode categoricals  \n","5) Temporal train/test split  \n","6) Model selection + final evaluation  \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mMhqwNy7eOKT"},"source":["## 1.
